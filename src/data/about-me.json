  "Throughout my career I have worked with big, demanding brands in multi-national environments. I thrive in the international atmosphere, where different cultures exchange ideas and where dreams dare to be bold.",

"I have gained some insights and experiences from my previous workplaces, but also learned that each new job and its context requires you to be able discard your existing pre-conceptions and not filter everything through the lenses of your past.",

  "The Web, and primarily JavaScript with all its flavors, dialects and libraries is my expertise, be it backend or front-end, although I do love working with UI:s the most. In my side projects I also navigate other topics, such as native development and more complex full stack endeavours with broader scopes.",

  "Like to think of myself as a quality-oriented, agile-minded team player who enjoys being involved in all aspects of development, caring for the business aspects, taking ideas through the process from creation to continuously releasing features. Basically, itâ€™s fun to solve problems, it does not really what matter in which context the problem is solved.",

  "I am a curious person who is passionate about development and like to contribute that enthusiasm to the company culture. I am also passionate about my hobbies, such as music production, photography and gymnastics.",

  "On Spotify you will find my music under the pseudonym PREYBIRD. There is a link in the 'social' section."
